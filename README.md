# **Quiz Web Application**

This is a project where I practiced learning the React library.

# **App description:**

This is a small web application in which you need to answer questions in a test format.
There are 25 questions about the React library in total.
The entire application consists of one page, there is no routing here.

# **The following basic skills have been worked out:**

1. Using the useState and useEffect hooks (with dependencies);
2. Using localStorage;
3. Using onClick events on elements;
4. Import icons, libraries, hooks and components;
5. Using conditional rendering using the ternary operator
6. Working with props;
